<Callout title="Alpha release">
  DatabaseChat is in alpha. Expect breaking changes as the API settles.
</Callout>

DatabaseChat lets users ask questions about your data in plain English. It streams responses,
calls your Convex queries as tools, and stores conversations in your own tables.

## What it provides

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Conversation storage | Stores chat history in `conversations` and `messages` tables |
| Delta-based streaming | Efficient O(n) streaming via delta accumulation |
| Abort support | Stop generation mid-stream with cleanup |
| Tool calling | LLM can call your Convex queries |
| React hooks | `useDatabaseChat`, `useMessagesWithStreaming`, and more |
| Client wrapper | `defineDatabaseChat()` for type-safe integration |

## What you implement

| Your code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tool definitions | Describe what data the LLM can access |
| Query functions | Convex queries or actions that back each tool |
| Chat wrapper | App-side endpoints that call the component |
| System prompt | Instructions that shape responses |
| UI | Your chat interface (or hook-based integration) |

## How it works

1. User sends a message from your UI.
2. Your app calls `components.databaseChat.chat.send` with tools, prompt, and API key.
3. The component streams deltas and executes tool calls as needed.
4. The UI subscribes to deltas and displays streaming content.

## Next steps

- Follow the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) to wire up tools and endpoints.
