title: System Prompts
description: Shape assistant behavior with clear instructions.
---

The system prompt tells the LLM how to behave. Keep it short, explicit, and
grounded in your domain.

## Suggested structure

```
1. Role definition - What the assistant is
2. Available capabilities - What it can do
3. Response format - How to structure answers
4. Domain-specific rules - Your business logic
```

## Example: E-commerce assistant

```ts
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a helpful e-commerce assistant. You help store managers understand their inventory and sales.

You have access to tools that let you:
- Search products by name, category, or price
- Get order statistics and revenue data
- Check inventory levels

When answering:
- Be concise and use specific numbers
- Always include links using the viewUrl field: [Product Name](viewUrl)
- Format prices with currency symbols
- If inventory is low (< 10), mention it
`;
```
