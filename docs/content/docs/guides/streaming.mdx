description: How delta-based streaming works.
---

DatabaseChat streams responses as deltas instead of full text snapshots. This
keeps bandwidth O(n) instead of O(n^2).

## Why deltas

Traditional streaming sends the full accumulated response on each update:

- Update 1: "H" (1 byte)
- Update 2: "He" (2 bytes)
- Update 3: "Hel" (3 bytes)

For a 1000 character response, this can send roughly 500,000 bytes.

Delta-based streaming sends only new text:

- Delta 1: "H" (1 byte)
- Delta 2: "e" (1 byte)
- Delta 3: "l" (1 byte)

For a 1000 character response, you send about 1000 bytes total.

## Stream lifecycle

`stream.getStream` returns a `StreamState` with one of:

- `streaming`
- `finished`
- `aborted`

The component:

- Creates a stream when generation starts.
- Writes deltas to `streamDeltas` as parts arrive.
- Deletes deltas on finish or abort.
- Cleans up finished streams after a short delay.

## Client accumulation

Use the provided hooks for accumulation:

- `useStreamingContent` for a single streaming block.
- `useMessagesWithStreaming` to merge streaming content into the message list.

If you need a custom integration, query `stream.listDeltas` with a cursor and
concatenate any `text-delta` parts in order.

## Custom LLMs

For custom SDKs, use `DeltaStreamer` from the component to write deltas while
you stream from your own provider.
